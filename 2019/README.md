# Advent of Code 2019

This is my second attempt at Advent of Code, my first time around I only lasted
a couple of days. My language of choice is still ReasonML, same as last year.

## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an online event created by Eric Wastl. Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight (EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!

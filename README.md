## What is Advent of Code?

Advent of Code is an online event created by Eric Wastl. Each year, starting on Dec 1st, an advent calendar of small programming puzzles are unlocked once a day at midnight (EST/UTC-5). Developers of all skill sets are encouraged to solve them in any programming language they choose!

## Experience

This is challenging for me, but I also really really like it. I don't do these types of problems apart from the yearly Advent of Code. I also don't encounter the algorithms used in my professional work.

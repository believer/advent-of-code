## Performance

I've tested performance using `std::time::Instant` and taken the fastest time from a couple of runs with release build. This is not the most exact measure and times this fast can probably be wrong, but it's at least some form of measure of how fast Rust is. Computer is a MacBook 2,6 GHz 6-Core i7, 32 GB RAM, Radeon 5300M 4 GB.

/* Part One
 *
 * You board your plane only to discover a new problem: you dropped your boarding pass!
 * You aren't sure which seat is yours, and all of the flight attendants are busy with the
 * flood of people that suddenly made it through passport control.
 *
 * You write a quick program to use your phone's camera to scan all of the nearby
 * boarding passes (your puzzle input); perhaps you can find your seat through process of elimination.
 *
 * Instead of zones or groups, this airline uses binary space partitioning to seat people.
 * A seat might be specified like FBFBBFFRLR, where F means "front", B means "back", L means "left", and R means "right".
 *
 * The first 7 characters will either be F or B; these specify exactly one of the 128 rows on the
 * plane (numbered 0 through 127). Each letter tells you which half of a region the given seat is in.
 * Start with the whole list of rows; the first letter indicates whether the seat is in the
 * front (0 through 63) or the back (64 through 127). The next letter indicates which half of that region the seat is in,
 * and so on until you're left with exactly one row.
 *
 * For example, consider just the first seven characters of FBFBBFFRLR:
 *
 * Start by considering the whole range, rows 0 through 127.
 * F means to take the lower half, keeping rows 0 through 63.
 * B means to take the upper half, keeping rows 32 through 63.
 * F means to take the lower half, keeping rows 32 through 47.
 * B means to take the upper half, keeping rows 40 through 47.
 * B keeps rows 44 through 47.
 * F keeps rows 44 through 45.
 * The final F keeps the lower of the two, row 44.
 *
 * The last three characters will be either L or R; these specify exactly one of the
 * 8 columns of seats on the plane (numbered 0 through 7). The same process as above proceeds again,
 * this time with only three steps. L means to keep the lower half, while R means to keep the upper half.
 *
 * For example, consider just the last 3 characters of FBFBBFFRLR:
 *
 * Start by considering the whole range, columns 0 through 7.
 * R means to take the upper half, keeping columns 4 through 7.
 * L means to take the lower half, keeping columns 4 through 5.
 * The final R keeps the upper of the two, column 5.
 * So, decoding FBFBBFFRLR reveals that it is the seat at row 44, column 5.
 *
 * Every seat also has a unique seat ID: multiply the row by 8, then add the column.
 * In this example, the seat has ID 44 * 8 + 5 = 357.
 *
 * Here are some other boarding passes:
 *
 * BFFFBBFRRR: row 70, column 7, seat ID 567.
 * FFFBBBFRRR: row 14, column 7, seat ID 119.
 * BBFFBBFRLL: row 102, column 4, seat ID 820.
 * As a sanity check, look through your list of boarding passes. What is the highest seat ID on a boarding pass?

/* Part Two
 *
 * Ding! The "fasten seat belt" signs have turned on. Time to find your seat.
 *
 * It's a completely full flight, so your seat should be the only missing boarding pass in your list.
 * However, there's a catch: some of the seats at the very front and back of the plane don't exist on this aircraft,
 * so they'll be missing from your list as well.
 *
 * Your seat wasn't at the very front or back, though; the seats with IDs +1 and -1 from yours will be in your list.
 *
 * What is the ID of your seat?

/* Part One
 *
 * You reach the train's last stop and the closest you can get to your vacation island without getting wet.
 * There aren't even any boats here, but nothing can stop you now: you build a raft.
 * You just need a few days' worth of food for your journey.
 *
 * You don't speak the local language, so you can't read any ingredients lists.
 * However, sometimes, allergens are listed in a language you do understand.
 * You should be able to use this information to determine which ingredient contains which
 * allergen and work out which foods are safe to take with you on your trip.
 *
 * You start by compiling a list of foods (your puzzle input), one food per line.
 * Each line includes that food's ingredients list followed by some or all of the allergens the food contains.
 *
 * Each allergen is found in exactly one ingredient. Each ingredient contains zero or one allergen.
 * Allergens aren't always marked; when they're listed (as in (contains nuts, shellfish) after an ingredients list),
 * the ingredient that contains each listed allergen will be somewhere in the corresponding ingredients list.
 * However, even if an allergen isn't listed, the ingredient that contains that allergen could still be present:
 * maybe they forgot to label it, or maybe it was labeled in a language you don't know.
 *
 * For example, consider the following list of foods:
 *
 * mxmxvkd kfcds sqjhc nhms (contains dairy, fish)
 * trh fvjkl sbzzf mxmxvkd (contains dairy)
 * sqjhc fvjkl (contains soy)
 * sqjhc mxmxvkd sbzzf (contains fish)
 *
 * The first food in the list has four ingredients (written in a language you don't understand):
 * mxmxvkd, kfcds, sqjhc, and nhms. While the food might contain other allergens, a few allergens the food definitely contains are listed afterward: dairy and fish.
 *
 * The first step is to determine which ingredients can't possibly contain any of the allergens in any food in your list.
 * In the above example, none of the ingredients kfcds, nhms, sbzzf, or trh can contain an allergen.
 * Counting the number of times any of these ingredients appear in any ingredients list produces 5: they all appear once each except sbzzf, which appears twice.
 *
 * Determine which ingredients cannot possibly contain any of the allergens in your list. How many times do any of those ingredients appear?

/* Part Two
 *
 * Now that you've isolated the inert ingredients, you should have enough information
 * to figure out which ingredient contains which allergen.
 *
 * In the above example:
 *
 * mxmxvkd contains dairy.
 * sqjhc contains fish.
 * fvjkl contains soy.
 * Arrange the ingredients alphabetically by their allergen and separate them by commas to produce your canonical dangerous ingredient list.
 * (There should not be any spaces in your canonical dangerous ingredient list.) In the above example, this would be mxmxvkd,sqjhc,fvjkl.
 *
 * Time to stock your raft with supplies. What is your canonical dangerous ingredient list?

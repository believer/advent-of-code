/* Part One
 * As your flight approaches the regional airport where you'll switch to a much larger plane,
 * customs declaration forms are distributed to the passengers.
 *
 * The form asks a series of 26 yes-or-no questions marked a through z.
 * All you need to do is identify the questions for which anyone in your group answers "yes".
 * Since your group is just you, this doesn't take very long.
 *
 * However, the person sitting next to you seems to be experiencing
 * a language barrier and asks if you can help. For each of the people in their group,
 * you write down the questions for which they answer "yes", one per line. For example:
 *
 * abcx
 * abcy
 * abcz
 *
 * In this group, there are 6 questions to which anyone answered "yes": a, b, c, x, y, and z.
 * (Duplicate answers to the same question don't count extra; each question counts at most once.)
 *
 * Another group asks for your help, then another, and eventually you've collected answers from
 * every group on the plane (your puzzle input). Each group's answers are separated by a blank line,
 * and within each group, each person's answers are on a single line. For example:
 *
 * abc
 *
 * a
 * b
 * c
 *
 * ab
 * ac
 *
 * a
 * a
 * a
 * a
 *
 * b
 *
 * This list represents answers from five groups:
 *
 * The first group contains one person who answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
 * The second group contains three people; combined, they answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
 * The third group contains two people; combined, they answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
 * The fourth group contains four people; combined, they answered "yes" to only 1 question, a.
 * The last group contains one person who answered "yes" to only 1 question, b.
 * In this example, the sum of these counts is 3 + 3 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 11.
 *
 * For each group, count the number of questions to which anyone answered "yes". What is the sum of those counts?

/* Part Two
 * As you finish the last group's customs declaration, you notice that you misread one word in the instructions:
 *
 * You don't need to identify the questions to which anyone answered "yes";
 * you need to identify the questions to which everyone answered "yes"!
 *
 * Using the same example as above:
 *
 * abc
 *
 * a
 * b
 * c
 *
 * ab
 * ac
 *
 * a
 * a
 * a
 * a
 *
 * b
 * This list represents answers from five groups:
 *
 * In the first group, everyone (all 1 person) answered "yes" to 3 questions: a, b, and c.
 * In the second group, there is no question to which everyone answered "yes".
 * In the third group, everyone answered yes to only 1 question, a. Since some people did not answer "yes" to b or c, they don't count.
 * In the fourth group, everyone answered yes to only 1 question, a.
 * In the fifth group, everyone (all 1 person) answered "yes" to 1 question, b.
 * In this example, the sum of these counts is 3 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6.
 *
 * For each group, count the number of questions to which everyone answered "yes". What is the sum of those counts?
